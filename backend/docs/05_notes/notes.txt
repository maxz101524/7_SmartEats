This file contains weekly progress updates, team notes, reminders, 
clarifications, and challenges encountered during development.

Week of Feb 3, 2026 - A2: Project Foundations + Views + Templates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROGRESS:
- Set up split settings pattern (base.py, development.py, production.py)
- Configured environment variables using django-environ
- Created mealPlanning app with models: DiningHall, Dish, UserProfile, Meal
- Applied database migrations
- Added branching strategy documentation
- Established docs folder structure
- Implemented all 4 views (2 FBV + 2 CBV) as JSON API endpoints
- Built React frontend with component-based templates and routing
- Created reusable ShowData component for template reuse

VIEWS (Section 2) - Names, Types, and Purposes:

  1. dining_hall_view (FBV - HttpResponse)
     URL: /api/halls/ (name='dining_hall_list')
     Purpose: Returns all dining halls as JSON using HttpResponse(json.dumps(...))
     This is a manual approach — we serialize the queryset ourselves and wrap
     it in an HttpResponse, demonstrating low-level control over the response.

  2. dish_list_view (FBV - JsonResponse shortcut)
     URL: /api/dishes/ (name='dish_list')
     Purpose: Returns dishes with selected fields via JsonResponse (shortcut).
     JsonResponse is analogous to Django's render() — it's a convenience
     shortcut that handles serialization and content-type automatically.

  3. UserProfileBaseView (CBV - inherits from View)
     URL: /api/profiles/ (name='user_profiles')
     Purpose: Returns all user profiles as JSON. Inherits from django.views.View
     and implements the get() method manually. This gives full control over
     the request handling while using OOP structure.

  4. MealListView (CBV - inherits from ListView)
     URL: /api/meals/ (name='meal_history')
     Purpose: Returns all meals as JSON. Uses Django's generic ListView with
     model = Meal. Overrides render_to_response to return JSON instead of
     an HTML template. Demonstrates how generic views reduce boilerplate.

VIEWS EXPERIENCE NOTES (HttpResponse vs render, Base CBV vs Generic CBV):
- HttpResponse gives full control but requires manual serialization (json.dumps,
  setting content_type). JsonResponse/render() handles this automatically —
  useful when you just need to return data quickly without boilerplate.
- Base CBV (View) is flexible — you write the full get/post logic yourself,
  which is helpful for custom endpoints. Generic CBV (ListView) is great when
  your view maps directly to a model queryset, since it handles the query
  automatically and you only override what you need.

TEMPLATES (Section 3) - React Equivalents:
- Base.tsx acts as our base.html (shared Navbar, Outlet for content, Footer)
- Page components (Dishes.tsx, DiningHalls.tsx, Profiles.tsx) extend the base
  layout via React Router nested routes (equivalent to {% extends "base.html" %})
- .map() replaces {% for %}, conditional rendering replaces {% empty %}
- ShowData.tsx is a reusable template component shared across pages
